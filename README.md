# pollutantmean
This project includes four files. The pollutant mean creates a function which read the directory, the pollutant from a particular file/files and  then calculates the mean of the given pollutant from all the files
The complete cases create a function to read the data which are completed in either of the pollutants. Third file creates a correlation between the two variables and the fourth one displays the scatterplot of each pollutant for different dates.
